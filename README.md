**Brief Description:**
**Pantry Wizard**

Our we application is an application that uses Django for out backend, React for the frontend, MongoDb as the Database, and Axios to connect the backend and frontend. 
We used Google Authorization for the OAuth.
Pantry Wizard is a web application that retrieves ingredients as an input from the user, uses the Spoonacular API to fetch recipes that includes those ingredients and return it back to the user, which the user can save them to view later.
We also added a tool to return food related news to the user using the NEWS API. The search bar has the word "Food" on default and returns food news. The user can also change the word on the search bar and retrieve news related to anything.
